    <h1>Project Centralization</h1>
    <p>
      This site is created to corral all the little pages I make, with no clear end goal. 
      I'm trying to learn coding, but saying that is like saying I'm trying to learn languages. A lofty goal, with no real application.
      Hopefully, by trying little bits of different things, I can see which languages I like best, and what types of projects I lean towards.
